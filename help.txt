clamp() is a css function. 
Clamp except three  parameters. minimum size, maximum size and idel size the size you would like
First parameter is minimum size, when you use absolute value for that.
Second parameter is say 5vw. this middle one says if font size is above frist parameter than
revert it to second parameter

***Calculate the vw value by taking the difference in font size (22- 18), divide it by the difference in viewport
widths (1000 - 600), then multiply it by 100vw - smaller-viewport-width (100vw - 600px);




font-size:  5vw; what does mean ->vw from left to right or right to left your device screen 
vh, vw this viewport units is that they are automatically recalculated whenever the viewport changes
100vw or 100vh is always full screen
% of width and height are always based on parent element
100% width or height of its parent width or height

calc(2rem +1vw)  WE can set a minimum font-size, then scale the font with a small viewport multiple by using the calc()
property
